An electronic tree done with *Arduino C language* and *microcontroller programming*.    
The project consists of an electronic tree that comes out of a pot with 20 branches and at the end of each branch is a LED (there are 4 different colors).
On the pot is a button and for each press of it the current song will change (there are a total of 3 songs). 
There is also a potentiometer on the pot to adjust the volume.
